# Water simulation

Water surface simulation on Vulkan API with shallow water equations

In development

## Compilation 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
# Controls 

- **WASD+mouse** - 3D movement
- **LMB** - send distortion to the water
- **Q** - show water's vertex grid
- **Escape** - End simulation
